He suggested that the forum community join him in what he described as 'raw transaction fun' to break taint analysis. On March 8, 2013, <a href='https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150681.0'>Killerstorm proposed the use of Chaum blind signatures</a> to protect user’s privacy from the coordinator. <br/><br/> Later that year, Maxwell made the legendary post <a href='https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0'>Coinjoin: Bitcoin privacy for the real world</a> (Peter Todd coined the term), in which he introduces the foundations of the game-changing privacy technique. He mentions the need for same-denomination outputs, Tor or a similar anonymity network to obfuscate IP addresses, the use of coordinators and Chaum blind signatures, distributed coordinator markets, anonymity set, and DOS protection. <br/><br/> He simply laid out the ideas and set up a developer bounty to make them a reality.

To learn more about how Joinmarket works, read our <a href='https://www.coinjoins.org/wallets/joinmarket'>review here</a>. <br/><br/> Joinmarket was a success. It attracted a lot of liquidity and users gained a lot of privacy from using it. However, it wasn't perfect: the inherent nature of the system made it difficult to use, created sybil attack risks (later solved by fidelity bonds), and also the lack of blind coordination made participants aware of their peers' input and output linkages."

The wallets Breeze and <a href='https://hackernoon.com/introducing-hiddenwallet-full-block-spv-tumblebit-wallet-testing-release-1054a15a9bb1'>Hidden Wallet</a> (now Wasabi Wallet) were the main clients to use this privacy technique. <br/><br/> Compared to the original version of Joinmarket, Tumblebit was theoretically presented as superior because it allowed you to get a very high anonymity set, the user experience was better, and the coordinator couldn't deanonymize you. However, the high liquidity requirements and lack of incentives made it extremely long in practice (a few hours) and very high in fees. It had very few participants and as of 2023, every Tumbler service seems to have shut down."

In it, you separate your excess change from your UTXOs to mix and from the coordinator fee. Subsequently, your UTXOs to mix would form a coinjoin transaction that produces no toxic change outputs. <br/><br/> This alternative mechanism gives the impression that coinjoin transactions are fully efficient, but one must consider the entire experience from premixing to final mix to properly compare it to Wasabi.

While bitcoin can provide great privacy if you use it carefully, by default it is only a pseudonymous system of <a href='https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Invoice_address>addresses</a>, which makes it easy to make mistakes that can hurt your privacy such as reusing an address for multiple payments. <br/><br/> Using bitcoin by yourself is in no way anonymous, a crowd to hide in is required for your bitcoin transactions to gain anonymity. Coinjoins help you reclaim your privacy by breaking popular heuristics used to track bitcoin users such as the <a href='https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common-input-ownership_heuristic'>common-input-ownership heuristic</a>, and input to output deterministic link.",

      "answer": "Can coinjoins be deemed illegal?<br/><br/>From a user’s perspective, coinjoins follow the same legality pattern as Bitcoin. In other words, if Bitcoin is legal in your country then it is most likely that coinjoins are. If the funds that are coinjoined are considered illegal due to coming from theft or fraud, then it’s already illegal but that’s because of the nature of the funds rather than the nature of the coinjoin activity.<br/><br/>With coinjoins, if you want, you can decide to share your transaction information with confidentiality to any interested party to reveal your transaction flow (input to output) but that choice is now yours instead of being public by default.",

While it’s been reported that platforms do this, it's important to remember that they find themselves in the minority for now, and you can use platforms that don’t block coinjoined UTXOs, or use <a href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/best-p2p-decentralised-exchanges'>P2P exchanges</a>. This has nothing to do with coinjoins, per se.<br/><br/> It's also possible to selectively disclose your transaction history with an exchange platform if you believe this would help you get your coins accepted, however, this is not guaranteed.",

Like for the Internet and bitcoin, the vast majority of people using these technologies are regular individuals just going on about their lives. Financial privacy is quite usual in traditional banking today. Confidentiality with personal consumer data is standard across financial institutions in Western countries. Coinjoins only help Bitcoin users gain privacy to a comparable level enjoyed in the traditional financial system.",

      "question": "“Coinjoins will get your funds stolen.”",
      "answer": "A coinjoin is nothing more than a regular bitcoin transaction which allows multiple participants at the same time. All coinjoin participants hold their own private keys, so even if there is a central coordinator facilitating participants’ registrations, it does not take control of funds. Coinjoins are completely different from custodial mixing service providers, which are shady businesses with a history full of fraud and scams.<br/><br/>A coinjoin coordinator does not take custody, accept deposits or issue withdrawals as it never holds user funds. The coordinator works as a message whiteboard to facilitate the registration of different participants. By default, the coordinator should collect no personal information on users other than what is available publicly on the bitcoin blockchain. All transaction signing is done on the client side application, outside of the coordinator’s control. Learn more <a href='https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin'>about coinjoins here</a>.",

With one single coinjoin transaction, it is possible to reclaim your privacy on bitcoin. It gives you a second chance at protecting your personal information from prying eyes. Simply download, verify and install a wallet that supports coinjoin, generate a wallet and backup your seed phrase, deposit funds into your wallet and begin the coinjoin process.",

You have a right to buy privacy for a fee that you may deem acceptable or not.<br/><br/>Some coinjoins have a 0.3% fee charged by the coordinator for bitcoin that have not been coinjoined yet. Is that too much? Some coinjoins coordinator charge you 5% but allow you to bundle your coins to pay less, which has a substantial privacy tradeoff. There are different pricing models, and not all of them are crystal clear, but at least there are options.<br/><br/>Something to remember: there is no free lunch. It’s well understood now that if it’s free, you’re probably the product being sold. Did you know that you can even get paid to gain privacy on bitcoin? Some coinjoin implementations, have a market-based design allowing market makers to earn a fee providing liquidity to other participants looking to coinjoin.",

    {
      "question": "“Coinjoins just don’t work.”",
      "answer": "The goal of a coinjoin transaction is to conceal the history of your transactions from the public by having many different participants share the same transaction to obfuscate the flows of funds. On bitcoin, flows of funds are traceable by default within a transaction, using the direct link between its inputs and outputs. When multiple participants join together in a single bitcoin transaction, the direct links between inputs and outputs are loosened. The larger the group of participants, the larger the plausible deniability. Flows of funds are much harder to trace in a large group, which helps coinjoin participants reclaim their privacy. Coinjoins provide certain privacy guarantees by breaking popular chain analysis heuristics, which are basic assumptions used to track flows of funds on the public bitcoin network.",

      "answer": "Some people claim that governments, public authorities or surveillance agencies are in charge of the main coinjoin implementations, allowing them to de-anonymize users. While not all coinjoin designs are the same, what matters is that you use a wallet that has the least amount of information about you. You should use coinjoins such that you can still gain privacy even if the coordinator or wallet is acting against you. “Can do no harm” is an important feature of a coinjoin implementation that you must seek. Coinjoin software is open-source for both client-side and server-side code for all major implementations, which anybody can verify. Reproducible builds are also an important feature to verify that the software you download is the same as the open source code base.",

      "question": "“Coinjoins give you a false sense of privacy.”",
      "answer": "Coinjoins are not the end-all-be-all solution for your privacy on bitcoin. While coinjoining your bitcoin can help you reclaim your privacy, there are other things that you need to learn about such as network-level privacy, address labels, manual coin control, Tor and more. Even some privacy wallets offering coinjoins as a feature require users to take great care in ensuring that no personal information is leaked. It may sound overwhelming at first but some bitcoin wallets such as Wasabi Wallet make privacy easy by default.<br/><br/>Participating in a coinjoin transaction with potentially hundreds of other users, allows for many possibilities to link different inputs and outputs so a high level of plausible deniability can be gained. Your online behaviour also affects your privacy tremendously that technology cannot necessarily deal with. For instance, never share a bitcoin address on your social media account.",

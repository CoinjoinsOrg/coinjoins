Some coinjoin designs require a minimum number of inputs to have a valid transaction while other designs have a fixed number of inputs and outputs for all their transactions. The number of transactions required to achieve a given level of privacy should also be considered. <br/><br/>  All of these points are going to be used by blockchain analysts who try to find insights by searching all bitcoin transactions.",

Joinmarket is a marketplace of coordinators (takers) where you can easily switch coordinators if you're restricted, but it's far from providing perfect censorship resistance. <br/><br/> Coordinators need to enforce a certain level of UTXO censorship for DDOS protection against bad actors, and they all have a certain ban policy regarding attacks, which can range from temporary to permanent bans.
